The source code, including both content and build instructions, can be found at:

I manage my dependencies and automate my build using:

-   Yeoman
-   Bower
-   Grunt
    
The core of this site is built around Jekyll, but I use many other plugins and 
frameworks to help me write my CSS/JavaScript, or help me optimize this site.
