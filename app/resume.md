You can find the most up-to-date information about me in one of the following places:

1. My [Linkedin][li] profile contains my full resume and profile
2. My [Github][git] profile contains a portfolio of many of the projects I've worked on.

Those following three locations are always guaranteed to be up-to-date and should be considered the "canonical" versions of my resume and portfolio. You can find additional information about me at the following locations:

1. My condensed, one-page [pdf resume][pdf] for the highlights (Last updated Jan 2014)
2. My [StackCareers][sc] profile for more tech-related information
3. My [projects][proj] page on this website for detailed writeups
4. My [ReadyForce][rf] profile 

Though I do make an attempt to keep these additional sites as up-to-date as possible, they often lag behind by a few months in comparison to my Linkedin and Github profiles. Sorry about that.
