## About Me 

Hi, I'm Michael Lee. This website currently serves as a way for me to showcase my projects and dump miscellaneous tidbits in the form of a blog. Currently, I'm mostly interested in programming and computer science, so most of the content will be CS-oriented.

Want to know more about me? My [resume](/resume) page contains a fairly good summary of what I've been up to.


## Current projects and focuses

- Classes I'm taking
    - Machine Learning, Graphics, Networks, and Intro to Embedded
- Projects
    - [UW Formula Motorsports](http://uwformula.com/) -- currently working on telemetry software 
- Teaching:
    - Currently TA-ing: [CSE 311][cse311], the "introduction to theory/discrete math" course
    - Other courses I've TA-ed: 
        - [CSE142][cse142], [CSE 143][cse143], and [CSE 143x][cse143x] -- first and second introductory courses at UW. CSE 143x is an accelerated version of the course that covers material from both CSE 142 and 143.
        - [CSE 332][cse332] -- data structures, algorithms, and parallelism.
- Things I've written/am writing
    - [CSE 14x Style Guide][style] -- an (unofficial) style guide for CSE 14x series. Covers both Java-specific guidelines, commenting guidelines, and general code structure guidelines. Mostly finished, but is missing some content and could use some copy-editing.
    - [Curated Programming resources][curated] -- a collection of hand-picked resources for learning programming. In limbo, and will probably go through a bunch of changes when I find the time. (Maybe over summer?)
