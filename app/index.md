## About Me 

Hi, I'm Michael Lee. This website currently serves as a way for me to showcase my projects and dump miscellaneous tidbits in the form of a blog. Currently, I'm mostly interested in programming and computer science, so most of the content will be CS-oriented. 

Want to know more about me? My [resume](/resume) page contains a fairly good summary of what I've been up to.


## Current projects and focuses

-   Classes I'm teaching
    -   [CSE 143](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/14au/) (the second introductory programming class at UW)
    -   [FIG](http://fyp.washington.edu/connect-through-academics/first-year-interest-groups/) (a program to help freshman adjust to life at UW)
-   Extracurriculars
    -   [UW Formula Motorsports](http://uwashingtonfsae.com/) -- currently working on telemetry software
-   Classes I'm taking
    -   Physics (optics, light)
    -   Math (matrixes, differential equations)
    -   Philosophy (introduction to ethics)
