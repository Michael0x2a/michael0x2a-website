## About Me 

Hi, I'm Michael Lee. This website currently serves as a way for me to showcase my projects and dump miscellaneous tidbits in the form of a blog. Currently, I'm mostly interested in programming and computer science, so most of the content will be CS-oriented. 

Want to know more about me? My [resume](/resume) page contains a fairly good summary of what I've been up to.


## Current projects and focuses

-   Internship at Groupon
-   Revamping this website
